                    <p><br>
                        Kirkpatrick-seidel is an algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of points by using a 
                        Divide-and-Conquer approach. The Divide step comprises dividing the set of points into 2 
                        equal subsets based on their x-coordinate relative to a median line, while in the Conquer step, 
                        we recursively find the convex hull of each of subset. Finally, you merge the 2 convex hulls 
                        by finding the upper and lower bridges.

                        In the first step of the Convex hull algorithm, we identify the points with highest and the
                        least x-coordinates and mark them as pmin and pmax. If there are 2 or more points with the
                        same x-coordinate then we find the coordinate with the highest y and mark it as pu_min or 
                        pu_max and the coordinate with the least y coordinate out of the points with the same 
                        x-coordinate as pl_min or pl_max.

                        Now we compute the median x-coordinate of all the points and draw a line through the median with the 
                        equation x = a where a is the median of the points. After plotting the median, we split the set of 
                        points T to T_left and T_right which contains points to the left of the median line and the right of
                        the median line respectively. We are currently computing the upper hull so we will ignore the points
                        that have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of pu_min/pu_max. Finally, we will add 
                        pu_min to T_left and pu_max to T_right.
