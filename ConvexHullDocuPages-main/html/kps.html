                <p>The kps algorithm is an efficient solution to the convex-hull problem,particularly in dealing with degenerate cases
                (situations with collinear points or points with the same x-coordinate).It works by recursively dividing the points based on their x- coordinates and at each iteration it discards points that
                cannot contribute to the convex hull by pruning the search space in this manner this algorithm is more efficient and
                works on a better complexity.<br>
                The algorithm works as follows:
                The set of points is divided into two sets by a median line .We then find all the edges of the convex-hull that
                intersect the median line. We then proceed to remove points that cannot be a part of the convex-hull.we then recursively
                call the algorithm on the reduced search space.<br><br>
                DIVIDE AND CONQUER:<br> It is a class of algorithms where the problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems, do this recursively until the
                subproblem can be solved directly. We then merge the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the original
                problem.in most cases the divide and conquer approach is able to achieve a better time complexity solution than
                algorithms that solve the problem at once.<br><br>
                MEDIAN OF MEDIANS:<br> The algorithm divides a given dataset into small groups(typically groups of 5) and uses a simple sorting algorithm like
                bubble sort to sort the sub-group and then get the median of the sub-group ,it then treats the set of medians of
                subgroups as a new set and call the algorithm recursively on this new set.in this way we find the median of medians and
                this algorithms finds the median of a set of n points in O(n).

                <h2>KirkPatrick-Seidel Main Function</h2>
                <p>This is the main function of the code and the parameter S that we pass is the set of points for which we wish to find
                the convex hull and the function returns the set of points that form the convex hull for the given input.
                It begins by finding the points with the highest and lowest x-coordinate using the helper functions finMinX and
                findMaxX.
                It then builds the sets of points for the upper and lower hulls by considering the x-coordinate of each point relative
                to the median x-coordinate using the helper functions Tupper and Tlower.
                It recursively calls upperHull and lowerHull on these sets of points to find the upper and lower hulls respectively.
                The function finally combines the sets of points obtained from both the hulls respectively and returns the final answer
                after concatenating them and removing any duplicates.

                subsets.It filters the left and right subsets to remove points that lie below the line segments formed by pmin, pL, and

                <h2>Upper Bridge Function</h2>
                <p>This function is used to find an upperBridge for the set of points S and alpha is the median x-coordinate
                If the set had 2 or less points it just returns S.
                If not:
                It randomly creates pairs of the points in S and calculates the slopes for each line segment pair.
                It then finds the median slope among the non-vertical line segments and categorizes the line segment pairs into the
                lists Small,Equal and Large based on their slopes relative to the slopeMedian.
                It finds the point with the maximum y-intercept among all line segments whose slopes are equal to or greater than
                slopeMedian.It identifies a point with maximum x-coordinate(pm) and point with minimum x-coordinate(pk) on the line
                identified in the previous step and Based on the positions of pm, pk, and alpha, it selects candidate points for further
                processing.
                This is done as follows:

                If pm.x > alpha and pk.x <= alpha , then both pk and pm are likely on the upper hull and are returned directly. However,
                        If pm.x <=alpha, it indicates the maximum y-intercept line might be entirely to the left of the median. In this
                        case: for points (Pi,Pj) belonging to Small add all the points to candidates but for points(Pi,Pj) belonging to
                        (Large U Equal) add only Pj to candidates. Similarly: If pk.x> alpha, it indicates the maximum y-intercept line
                        might be entirely to the right of the median. In this case: for points (Pi,Pj) belonging to Large, add all the
                        points to candidates but for points (Pi,Pj) belonging to (Small U Equal) add only Pi to candidates.

                <h2>Complexity</h2>
                <p>
                    Kirk-patrick-seidel is a divide and conquer algorithm the upperHull and lowerHull algorithms are recursively called on
                    the set of points until the size of the set reaches a base case (less than or equal to 2).
                    In each recursive call, the median splits the data points into 2 equal sets of Tleft and Tright and hence for a set of
                    size n to be divided into a set of size 2 or lesser we need log(n) recursive calls.
                    And at each recursive call we have:
                    Finding the median x-coordinate: O(n) in the worst case.
                    Partitioning the set: O(n)
                    Bridge finding (upperBridge and lowerBridge): O(n) on average
                    Filtering points: O(n)
                    Therefore, the overall complexity is O(nlogn).
