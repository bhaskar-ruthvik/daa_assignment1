     "Jarvis march is a simple algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of points by iteratively finding the least counter clockwise point from a given origin at every step, much like wrapping a gift around a box, with the points of the convex hull marking its corners, where the next corner to be wrapped becomes the next origin. We keep wrapping around the points until we return to the initial origin.",
    "Kirkpatrick-seidel is a slightly more efficient algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of points by using a Divide-and-Conquer approach. The Divide step comprises dividing the set of points into 2 equal subsets based on their x coordinate relative to a median line, while in the Conquer step, we recursively find the convex hull of each of subset. Finally, you merge the 2 convex hulls by finding the upper and lower 'bridges'.",
    "The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest possible polygon that encloses all the points in the set while maintaing convexity. Given any 2 points in the point set, the line segment connecting them must be entirely enclosed within the convex hull. A convex hull can be thought of as a rubber band wrapped around a set of pins inserted in a board, such that the rubber band is stretched as tightly as possible."
