# Getting Started with the Convex Hull Visualisation Website

--- 

## Accessing the Website

[Website Link](convex-hull-visualisation-g2.vercel.app)

## Website Description

The following website has been designed as a tool to visualise two of the most popular convex hull algorithms step by step to see how they reach the conclusion. The website has been given a gamery aesthetic which can be seen through the fonts and the UI as we feel it suits our purpose very well.

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Documentation of the Algorithm

To view the documentation of the react app, you can run: 

### `npm run storybook`

Runs the storybook server which contains the documentation\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in your browser.

You can find the documentation of the algorithm and the project as a whole on the link below:
